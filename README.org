* Hebdomon - A LaTeX Class for Report Writing

Hebdomon is a latex documentclass for streamlining document creation in
latex.

Currently it supports minted out of the box.

The following packages are loaded for all OPTIONS

The document uses FiraSans for as fontstyle.

| PACKAGE    | DEFINITION                                             |
|------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| ~minted~     | For use in code presentation (requires python)         |
| ~nicematrix~ | For presenting matrices and tables in a cleaner syntax |
| ~graphicx~   | Inserting images into the document                     |

*** Adding Custom Commands

While it is up to the user to add whatever they wish, to keep track all of
the custom stuff it is recommend to put it in a position such as follows:

#+begin_src latex
%--CUSTOM-COMMANDS---------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{...}
\renewcommnad{...}
\def\lorem
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#+end_src

This would allow you to easily keep all of them organised. Then what do I
know, I am just a README file.
