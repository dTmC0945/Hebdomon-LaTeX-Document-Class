*** Adding Custom Commands

While it is up to the user to add whatever they wish, to keep track all of
the custom stuff it is recommend to put it in a position such as follows:

#+begin_src latex
%--CUSTOM-COMMANDS---------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{...}
\renewcommnad{...}
\def\lorem
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#+end_src

This would allow you to easily keep all of them organised.

Then what do I know, I am just a README file.
